                This chicken Florentine recipe “tastes like a special occasion dish 
                (because of loads of cream and cheese) or therapy in food form,” according to recipe developer Renu Dhar.

            <p class="paragraph">
                A Florentine dish typically consists of a protein, spinach, and a Mornay sauce (a béchamel sauce with cheese). 
                The dish allegedly dates back to the 1500s and it’s often attributed to French Queen Catherine de Medici, who was apparently partial to foods that reminded her of her native Florence.

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Stir together flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a medium bowl. Add chicken cutlets, one at a time, and toss to coat evenly with flour. Shake off excess flour, and set aside on a plate.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add butter and oil; cook, swirling occasionally, until butter is frothy, about 30 seconds. Add chicken in an even layer; cook, turning once halfway through, until browned and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of breast registers 165°F, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack.</li>
                    <li>Add wine to skillet; cook over high, stirring occasionally and scraping bottom to release brown bits, until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Stir in stock, cream, black pepper, garlic, oregano, thyme,  marjoram, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in spinach; cook, stirring often, until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Return chicken to skillet. Cook over medium-high, turning chicken once, until chicken is heated through, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat; add basil and Parmesan, swirling to combine.</li>
